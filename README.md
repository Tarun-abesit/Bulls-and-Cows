# Bulls-and-Cows
It is a game built using python language.
Bulls and Cows is a very famous tactic based game which is designed by me in a very simple way using python language support.
It is basically a guessing game which tests the logical ability as well as luck factor off the player.
Hope you will like it as its my beginning of my journey in the world of python. Please do tell any improvements in the code.
